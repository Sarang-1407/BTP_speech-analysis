good morning everybody dr. Huxley excellencies ladies and gentlemen it is
an honor to deliver the twenty first IISS fullerton lecture today in
singapore as a member myself of the International Institute of Strategic
Studies being invited to do so is a particular source of satisfaction
this invitation also brings me back to Singapore where I have so many warm
personal and professional memories it's good to see friends sitting in the audience I hope they'll be kind in the
Q&A session and so all in all really it's good to be back the topic for
today's talk is India the United States and China now I have represented my
country in both the US and China fairly recently and I've had a close
association or with the with both these relationships but this triangulation is
not just an outcome of my personal experience I would suggest that the
interplay of India with the US and China is among the key factors that will
determine the strategic balance in Asia and beyond Singapore naturally has an
interest in the dynamics of that process therefore I hope that sharing insights
on the current state of these ties would be of some value to all of you each of
these states is undergoing both external and internal transformation as we speak
so this exercise is not entirely without its complexities I'll begin with India not just because
I'm from India but also as it is a country where change has been sharpest
in the last year this has seen the emergence of a very different global
sentiment in regard to this nation that is a subject in itself and on this
occasion let me limit my remarks to the foreign policy implications of a government led
by Prime Minister Modi to begin with the approach to India's neighbours has
undergone a big shift symbolized by the invitation extended to their leaders
when the government was first sworn in since then we have seen teams of greater
connectivity stronger cooperation broader contacts dominate India's
engagement with them even in a short span of time some results are already
evident in the case of Bangladesh it includes the settlement of the land
boundary and major connectivity and infrastructure initiatives with Nepal
the long-standing potential for hydroelectric power is beginning to be tapped India was not only the first
responder during the earthquake but also the principal contributor to its
subsequent reconstruction efforts with Bhutan a traditionally strong
relationship has been further consolidated a sub regional grouping
involving all these countries is taking forward the connectivity and cooperation
agenda ties with Sri Lanka after elections in both countries have
increasingly focused on their national reconstruction and reconciliation
Myanmar remains a gateway for look and act East policy and the possibilities
for cooperation grow as they open up to India's West the relationship with
Pakistan has its share of challenges but is part of the neighborhood agenda that
I mentioned earlier our prime ministers met a week ago and agreed on steps
to counterterrorism and strengthen peace and tranquility on the border we hope to
take that forward where Afghanistan is concerned managing the consequences of
the drawdown of foreign forces is the primary exercise underway India supports
and afghan-owned an afghan-led reconciliation process within the framework of the Afghan Constitution and
internationally accepted red lines our traditional friendship with the Afghan people has been reinforced through an
effective development program in that country with Iran the resolution of the
nuclear dispute and the lifting of sanctions will allow our agenda of energy and connectivity cooperation to
unfold seriously beyond the immediate neighbourhood be it Southeast Asia
Northeast Asia or the Middle East we see fertile ground that needs more sustained
cultivation nations they seem ready to respond to a more businesslike India
India's maritime interests are significant and I would remind you that we are a nation with a 7500 kilometer
coastline a 1200 islands and an easy of 2.4 square km a million square
kilometers what happens to our South is of great consequence not least because
of our trade and our energy imports in recent months considerable thought has
been given to an integrated Indian Ocean Strategy it is obviously one devoted to
safeguarding our mainland and Islands and defending our interests we seek to
deepen economic and security cooperation especially with maritime neighbors this
has been reflected in cooperation on exchange of information and coastal surveillance building of infrastructure
and strengthening of capabilities we believe that collective action and cooperation will best advance peace and
security in our maritime region we see an integrated in cooperative future for
the region that enhances prospects for sustainable development and we think that those who are resident
in this region have the primary responsibility for peace stability and
prosperity in the Indian Ocean insofar as larger international politics is
concerned India welcomes the growing reality of a multipolar world as it does
of a multipolar Asia we therefore want to build our bilateral relations with
all major players confident that progress in one account opens up
possibilities in others also of note is the more regional approach to engagement
reflected in the Prime Minister's recent visits to the Indian Ocean Northeast
Asia and Central Asia summit level meetings with the Pacific Islands and
Africa will take place in India for the first time this year you would have
already noted more energetic diplomacy that seeks a larger and deeper footprint
in the world supported by soft power initiatives like the International Day of yoga the transition in India is an
expression of greater self confidence its foreign policy dimension is to
aspire to be a leading power rather than just a balancing one consequently there
is a willingness to shoulder greater global responsibilities this was demonstrated recently in humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief operations in Yemen and then in a pulp it is also reflected in our role in
peacekeeping and in keeping the maritime Commons safe and secure and it is
affirmed by India's active participation in important global negotiations an
aspect of our current approach while having implications for the entire world
has a special relevance for its two largest economies the United States and China India is endeavoring to modernize
in the fullest sense of the term this is expressed in a variety of programs
ranging from make in India little india and hundred smart cities to
skill india and clean india it seeks resources technology and best practices
from our internet from our international partners that is very much at the heart of our diplomatic engagement today both
the US and China and indeed the ASEAN Japan ROK and Europe can contribute to
this transformation the centrality of this commitment ensures that India will
set a positive and interactive agenda with other major powers and groupings we
look at the world seeing more possibilities and risks and are
confident that in turn India itself will be viewed as an opportunity by the world
at the end of the day India's future is of a human resources power that will be
a key calculation in how others including US and China will approach us
let me now turn to the United States and the state of our ties with them there is
little doubt that the US economy is in a recovery mode it is probable that in
pursuing its interests the United States will seek to leverage its comparative
strengths that include technology finance and its international partnerships the issue then is the
extent to which those partners have a convergence of interests with the United States in the case of India that is
quite significant let me illustrate that using some recent examples when
President Obama came to India in January this year the two countries agreed on a
joint strategic vision for the asia-pacific and Indian Ocean region we
affirmed our shared interest in safeguarding maritime security and ensuring freedom of navigation and
overflight throughout the region we opposed terrorism piracy and WMD
proliferation and we urged all parties to avoid the threat or use of force and
pursue resolution of disputes through peaceful means in accordance
with international law the vast expanse of practical cooperation laid out on the
token is also worth noting on the economic side there is a promise of an
expanded investment flows collaborating on skills development furthering India's
digital emissions and expanding capabilities ranging from health to
education in areas where the United States has traditionally dominated such
as space nuclear energy and R&D new collaborative initiatives were agreed
upon the entire spectrum from defense counterterrorism homeland security
intelligence sharing and law enforcement are being taken to a new level in global
economic political security and technology areas the two nations are working together on a number of issues
the deepening and broadening of the india-us relationship has been among the
key elements of a changing Asian calculus this process which has unfolded
unevenly in the last two decades has definitely acquired new energy in the
last year obviously the two countries would not agree completely on all issues
but their ability to work together is a factor worthy of serious consideration
with China the changes are more nuanced more complex but no less significant
again I used the recent visit of Prime Minister Modi to China and his meeting
with President Xi Jinping to illustrate my argument on that occasion the
terminology agreed upon by the two countries to describe themselves where
as two major powers in the region and the world I would suggest and I'm sure
the China watchers in this room would agree that this is not without meaning the task which they have set for
themselves is to pursue the national development goals and security interests
in a mutually supportive manner clearly this would only happen if India
and China show respect and sensitivity to each other's concerns interests and
aspirations that the two neighbors whose parallel if differential rice offers a
somewhat unique situation in world history agreed on a constructive model
of relationship is no small thing path presidents in history have been largely
otherwise that this is not just a good this is not just a conceptual
proposition those of you who would have watched the Medici interaction in Xi'an
would have noted this approach reflected in the demeanor the mood today
allows for Frank and direct conversations between the leadership's their shared appearances including the
world's most powerful selfie and utterances would have been difficult to
envisage a year ago but as with the United States it is what is happening on
the ground that can make these sentiments sustainable so let me talk a
little about recent developments in that regard on the economic side the
discourse has been traditionally dominated by the growing trade imbalance a source of unhappiness for India as it
reflects lack of market access admittedly that continues to be a major
challenge one that the two Prime Minister's not in the Modi and liqour chunk agreed would be taken up by a
high-level task force but attention has now turned to the possibilities offered
by investments to Chinese industrial parks are under development in
Maharashtra and Gujarat other private investment in private investment
initiatives are moving forward in fact Prime Minister Modi's meeting in
Shanghai with Chinese CEOs probably saw the strongest foreign interest that I
have heard expressed in the make in India program in all the visits that have accompanied him
knowing the gaps between the two systems there will be processed challenges that
I would delicately suggest may be an opportunity for Singapore collaboration
is also unfolding in a number of other sectors especially in the modernization of India's railway infrastructure the
standard narrative of sino-indian relations however remains focused on the
border dispute and security issues sure I would draw attention to efforts to
enhance communications between the militaries promote leadership level
exchanges establish more hotlines expand border commanders exchanges and create
more meeting points on the border the political settlement of the boundary
question is obviously a complicated issue but there is recognition today that both on both sides that peace and
tranquillity on the border is an important guarantor for the development and continued growth of our bilateral
relations we are also moving to address the familiarity gap in the relationship
and outcome of the difficult paths of our shared history new policy and
governance level mechanisms and platforms have been formed recently promoting contacts between think tanks
and media have been given a special boost sensitivity displayed in respect
of religious tourism has gone down well in both countries the direction we are
moving should be clear even if much work remains to be done so my message to you
today is that India engages the world with greater confidence and assurance it
does so with the intent of ensuring stronger growth greater connectivity
closer integration and deeper harmony it wants to expand its commonalities and
manage its differences it is prepared to shoulder greater responsibility and
expects that this would be duly reflected in the structure of the international order with specific
reference to India's ties with the in China let me say that we approach them both positively in doing so we look
beyond twentieth-century orthodoxies he showed me bubonic writing of the great
convergence some time ago wondered if geopolitics would derail it
even as realists we should calculate that our shared stakes in prosperity and
stability will temper risk-taking after all realism applies even more to economics
than it does to security signals however remain mixed though the more alarmist
scenarios have proved unfounded Asia will no doubt go through some
uncertainties before arriving at a new equilibrium other factors and other
nations will definitely have a say too among them ASEAN members Japan or
Australia share power if it works for all parties will be at the heart of Asia's emerging
security architecture and that I believe warrants following this triangle very
closely thank you very much
foreign secretary thank you very much for your your excellent address you you
talked you talks in some detail about how the Modi government is pursuing a
more active foreign policy approach linked to development programs at home
you you talked particularly about India's relations with its with its
immediate immediate neighbors and and region in the East and South and West you talked about an integrated Indian
Ocean Strategy and then you went on to talk in some detail about India's
developing relationships with both the US and and China in their various
dimensions and in in your conclusion I think you said something very important about the the need for India to approach
both China and the United States positively and the importance of the
notion of shared power in the emerging regional security architecture in this
huge Asian region well I think there's a lot of food for thought there and
there's now an opportunity for members of our our audience to ask questions if
you is if you wish to to ask a question of the foreign secretary could you please raise your hand the microphone
will come to you and if the microphone does come to you could you please then
say who you are what you do or who you are associated with and ask your
question as US briefly and is in a pointed of fashion as as possible
thank you very much who would like to ask the first question
Simon hey mrs. eka tree I'm Simon's here and the chairman of the Singapore Shiva
national affairs welcome back to Singapore secretary I know that you've talked about two very big players United
States and China very important and may I ask a bit of a hard question to other
people which really kind the frame facing same dilemmas but haven't talked about one is ASEAN and I think President
Ma T is - most be very active overseas but not so much of course in ASEAN as a
whole though he's been in Singapore the second question is about so basically do
you see the chances of ASEAN working India or no way trying to make their
policies in parallel the second issue is Pakistan China's steps was Pakistan
you've talked about win-win would Pakistan be part of that or is there some some degree of competition Colin
bachelor thank you very much Simon well I I think
I was constrained by the fact that I had to come up with a definite topic and
limit myself to some countries in the world so I think the fact that I haven't
addressed our other relationship is in no way an implication that those
relationships are less important you know where the ASEAN is concerned I
think at one level we are there's a very strong continuing recognition that ASEAN
played and plays a very important role in globalizing India I mean the whole
look East and now we are trying to to communicate a sense of urgency to
various ASEAN related projects and policies so we keep telling people at
least don't just look east and the I I
think that continues very much if you look today at individual relationship
with ASEAN members as well as our collective ASEAN relationship or the the
importance of the EAS for in India's foreign see I mean you can see the huge
difference that ASEAN has made to our foreign policy in the last 25 years
having said that I think we we have some some real issues to address including
you know connectivity issues and I specifically mentioned Myanmar Kia because until we get our physical
connectivity to Myanmar in in better order the the ASEAN remains somewhat
distanced from us so we are we are actually devoting a lot of attention to
that we have you know we are today involved in building the trilateral highway some parts of the trilateral
highway we have a big connectivity project to the port of citta way and
overall overall the Myanmar relationship has has a certain prominence simply
because it is the part of ASEAN which which abuts us in fact I myself in in
the short tenure that I've had in my current job have already been twice to to Myanmar so so I I would just say to
you that you know this is something which is important you know whether it's
trade resources as a the window to the world as an operating base you know I
mean I think ASEAN means different things to us because and and what we
also have stakes today in strengthening ASEAN you know I I think it's important
that the the coherence and the solidarity that ASEAN that has kept
ASEAN alive continue and that's very much in our interest as well the other
other question Pakistan well I did mention that Pakistan is part of the
neighborhood agenda I mean it is a somewhat different neighbor I grant you that but the fact is whether it is trade
whether it is connectivity I mean all the logic of the neighborhood also applies to Crysta I mean that that but we have
disputes with Pakistan of a nature that we really don't have with any of our
other neighbors and that does make the relationship that much more challenging
and you know we're better you know what the China Pakistan relationship means in
that context I I think some you know again the issue for us is really better
the nature of that relationship impinges on our security interests or not and and
recently on our sovereignty as well so those those I think are our life issues
and obviously we will continue today with thank you very much mr. Surya Surya
Narayan from the Institute of South Asian Studies and welcome to Singapore certainly if I could inject a little bit
more of geometry into the triangulation from the Indian perspective is this
triangle a right angled triangle meaning that the u.s. might help India become a
leading power and also helped India safeguard centers better in relation to China or will this be a totally acute
angle triangle which would mean that India will be on its own in navigating
the triangular equation forward and secondly there is this issue of core
interests and concerns with regard to China and Pakistan for India and recently two issues have a pinched on
the core interests and concerns of India namely the release of lockrey
in Pakistan and the route map of the china-pakistan economic corridor which
impinges on India Pakistan boundary issue how does India plan to address these two
issues beyond expressing concerns to China in diplomatic gatherings thank you
well I think if I remember my geometry I
wasn't very good at geometry but but you know I I think I can fairly confidently
I mean it's clearly not an equilateral triangle it's not an isosceles triangle I think each of these triangles is a the
length is is is different but I I would
say frankly if India is to raise its ambitions and raise the level of its
game at the end of the day India has to do it you know you can you can you sort
of utilize for foreign partnerships to to help you and take you along but your
long-term calculation cannot be posited on other people's game plans otherwise
they are really not sustainable so I my own senses today the the mood in India
is that look it's we are a country which we should have reasonable ambitions we
should be doing more we should be making our presence felt we should be helping the world as well I mean I am NOT
putting it purely in transactional terms and and a lot you know and III think
that's in many ways being a shift in the in the in the sort of sense in which
today foreign policy is being implemented you know when you look at our responses to different negotiations
and different situations I I think that is coming through in in different ways
where you refer to you know issues like the lucky
problem lucky is the Wow you know one of the prime accused in the Mumbai Mumbai
attack terrorist attack case and and the
other other issue which mr. Surya Narayana raised was for those who are not familiar the the china-pakistan
economic corridor passes through Pakistan Occupied Kashmir on which we
have a claim so yes these are these are issues I think we we don't shy away from them I
mean they are discussed publicly they are discussed privately the we're discussed when Prime Minister met you
know when he was recently in Nova he many met President Xi and when he met
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and I mean in today's world I mean when you have
disputes with people you reason with people so obviously we will continue reasoning with the parties involved
thank you very much sir noise I think
our welcome back to Singapore Atul from global schools foundation my question is more on making India and
and the question is very simple the the campaign has been very successful and as
we speak with many people around the world it's really catching attention for people to consider investing in India but is India having the right
administrative structure for example the IPP which is led by an Islamic Afghan
has been doing a fantastic job is a great individual but does it need to be elevated to something like a ministry of
economy or a Economic Development Board in Singapore context which has far
larger powers and is able to really meticulously follow up on large leads
coming up from various parts of the world I think the large bit ticket investors would need a lot of confidence
and comfort in dealing with getting the central administrative process is done so the question is is it does it need to
really revamp the sector side well you know my own take I'm in a sense part of
the system but because I'm from the foreign ministry we have a certain objectivity when it comes to this issue
I I think the challenge is not of elevating it and in a sense centralizing
it see what India needs is for the routine to work not for the exceptions
to work and so if the routine bureaucracy on you
know the 24/7 365 days a year this this really works I think that's
really what we are trying to change and bear in mind that when you actually come
down to manufacturing you are actually going to States so it isn't again a
central government issue alone it is also what happens sort of where the rubber hits the road and that's in the
states so the the the messy you know
there has been in the last year continuous sort of campaign to make it
easier to do business to make it easier to do business for Indian business because unless we make it easier for our
own business we won't make it easier for foreign business businesses don't in real life come in two categories so I
think that's been very much at the heart of the process of change because finally
what what people are looking at today is employment only manufacturing can give
us the numbers that a country like India needs you know people talk of India
being a young society and demographic dividend but you get a demographic dividend only if you have if you can
create employment possibilities and you can only create employment possibilities if you expand manufacturing which is
really a very very you know uncomfortably low proportion of the GDP
today it's 15 16 percent so so pushing up industrialization put pushing up
manufacturing and getting the system on a routine basis to respond better I
think that's to my mind the real challenge yes there will be cases big
cases where we will have to do hand-holding we'll have to do hand-holding because you need to to
demonstrate examples to change sentiment you know are you so people need to see
successes to believe that change is happening but I would still say that to
me would be a process on the way the real change would come when when
actually the SOPs at the state level start changing thank you sir
foreign secretary my name is James tang I'm from these groups of sciences at
Singapore Management University earlier on you indicated that India wanted to
approach both China and the United States positively at the same time you
also said that in there as a major country is not going to be reactive in
there once you have a proactive approach to what's going on in the Asia Pacific
area I guess but obviously all the major
players now have projected very different visions of what they want to
see in this part of the world the United States still I think talks about the
pivot Xi Jinping in China talked about Chinese dream and now the Chinese are
also talking about this looking west one belt one road India seems to be
emphasizing at East I'm just wondering what sort of India's own vision you also
mentioned shared power and just thinking about what what sort of is this a
contest or is this sort of you are seeing a different way of structuring international relationship and you see
India playing a more active role in this part of the world and what would that be thank you thank you well no thank you
for that question oh you know I yes I I think it is natural that different players would
express their interest in different ways I mean you mentioned in the case of
China is China dream on this side it's go west on that side is one belt one road so the combination of these kind of
give you a sense of what what the Chinese are tabling I think it's in the nature of Chinese
policy making to to define their their goals in a certain way with a with a
they find neat phrases and you know III
trying personally think it's a very admirable trait you know it helps you to understand the thinking of the of the
Chinese better others may not quite do the same but they have table that
interests are indicated that interests in different ways perhaps not with the degree of clarity maybe in some cases
they haven't also got their sort of practical projects on the ground to the
extent the Chinese have in our own case I think we are moving in that direction I mean clearly when we say look east or
at least it's a it's a certain messaging to the ASEAN it's a messaging to the world about the centrality of the ASEAN
LED processes in our foreign policy I think in the recent months you have this
phrase of neighborhood first which is um again a message and lot of this are to
your own people because your systems must know what is it you know what is it that you have all agreed to do what is
your national goal so when we say today neighborhood first it is a primacy of
lot of this connectivity cooperation projects expanding contacts in the
neighborhood that we are prepared to put in more money in the neighborhood prepared to deal with them very differently so that's the messaging out
there I think we'll have to as we get more active clearly will have to invent
more phrases I I can see my my creativity department working overtime
there you know we just came from a tour of Central Asia where the Prime Minister
visited I think for the first time by any prime Indian Prime Minister all five Central Asian states back to back other
than Russia so so there is the today as capabilities grow as interests expand as
opportunities grow as confidence grows a country like India will set out its
goals for different parts of the world we will come up with something probably for the Middle East as well now the the
challenge would be you know in a very dynamic situation where you know different economies are growing at
different paces you know the sort of you you really don't have too many
precedents and practices to go by well we are moving into unchartered waters I
think Asia is moving into more unchartered waters than other parts of the world and I but except I don't think
that somewhere there is an inevitability of a contestations because you know
because there is dynamism dynamism doesn't automatically translate into powers contesting each other I mean yes
there will be there will be some jostling there will be differences there will be argumentation but there will
also be the shared interest you know people don't nobody has an interest in rocking the boat beyond a point
hopefully so so I think you will see this duality that there will be new
agendas coming on the table but there will also be new mechanisms to reconcile those agendas so I would sort of see it
more like restructuring a company you know new shareholders different shareholders the shares are changing
maybe some new Board of members in the Board of Directors may be some independent directors now how do you get
this company to do sort of do business better than it used to thank you
professor Canty bajpai County watch fire from the
liquid in school I have three very quick questions maybe they add up to one the first is is
there reluctance on India's part to get involved in the Silk Route concept that the Chinese have advanced I mean we're
in the AIB the new Development Bank but there's a certain kind of a hesitation
that you sort of sense on new delhi's part in respect of the Silk Route so
that's my first question is that true and if so why the second relates to India's recent I
guess full membership now in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization within
a year or so is there going to be a quid pro quo which is that but we will accept
with other sock members that China will become a full member of of sod from its
current status which is I guess an observer and third point relates to the
Pakistan China India relationship in a slightly different direction from the one that you pointed to which is China's
continuing continuing very deep involvement in Pakistan's nuclear program I think at last count at least
four or five new reactors coming online to be built by the Chinese and we know
that you know the Chinese the Pakistani weapons program a peace in respect of
fissile materials is going very very fast so while the Chinese involvement is
civilian you know there may be implications for the military as well so
my question I guess if some all that up is are things more complex and difficult
perhaps then you've suggested in respect of the China relationship India somewhat
reluctant on the Silk Route even though we talk about connectivity India hasn't
been very forthcoming about perhaps China being a full member of sock and are you worried about the growing
Chinese involvement on the nuclear issue with Pakistan Thanks
well first of all on the Chinese connectivity initiatives I mean let's
sort of day they've aggregated them different initiatives into one belt one
Road you see where we are concerned this
is a national Chinese initiative I mean the Chinese devised it the Chinese created a blueprint it
wasn't an international initiative that they discussed with whole world or the countries which in some way or the other
have a opinion or a who are affected by it so if if there is a national initiative
and a country is going ahead with implementing a national initiative it is
not incumbent on other countries to necessarily bite because a national initiative is device with international
interest an international or regional initiative has other interests which are reconciled into that so where we stand
is that if if this is something on which they want a larger binding then they
need to have larger discussions and those haven't happened now insofar as a
IIb is concerned we have no hesitation I mean we are we are actually the second largest shareholder of a IIb and you
know we made our a IIb decision well before a lot of other countries did so
we you know there was this last-minute haste once some countries broke ranks
with each other but we were not part of that you know we made us much much earlier and we did so from a very
sensible calculation that a IIb will
provide a new source of financing the world needs a new source of financing for development projects and that kind
of long-term funding of development projects is you know the the demands are
growing the sources are drying up so so we welcome the new player and we felt we could we could help shape it and join it
and strengthen it by being in it so we don't have a reservation about a IIb I
think for us the issue I would separate the one belt one road issue from the AI
I wish only full membership of the SEO yes at offer the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization welcomed India and Pakistan as as members full members for whom the
membership negotiation begins so there is a membership process so we have to go
through that I mean people estimate that it will take us a year and but this is
something the is done on its merits because the Shanghai Cooperation Organization is a
functional group you know it's not a geographical group whereas I think in
the case of Sark Sark is I mean the operative words of Sark is satisha
Sark is a group like ASEAN now ASEAN has
a geography connotation if tomorrow let's say Iceland wants to be a member
of ASEAN you Iceland is not located in in Southeast Asia so you it's it's difficult to bring
bring in Iceland so I think we shouldn't really compare apples and oranges here I
I think a CEO has a very clear sort of functional non-geographical connotation
Sark has a geographical connotation so I think trading that is something which
doesn't appear logical to me in the case of the package the China Pakistan
nuclear collaboration you know see for us it has been a source of concern that
when we did our nuclear understanding with the United States and then
broadened it out to other countries we went to the NSG for approval of the
understandings so sort of we played by
the rules we we went through a separation program so I would say we be
made a huge effort to be in conformity with global norms both in the nature of
the program and in the transactions that we do with other countries after that so
when we see you know the developments
between China and Pakistan and then look at where the NSG stands on this I think
it is something more than us it is something the energy should be asking itself thank you very much we have time
for one or two more questions on left hand side here at the back hi my
name is Simon I'm from the Ministry of Defense my I have two questions to to you my first
question is what is the perception of the Indian leadership towards the rise
of China and the second question is how much do you think generally the Indian
leadership understands the Chinese leadership well I look I I think when
you say rise of China I mean people the rise of China has
happened okay so it is not an issue of whether you like it don't like it what I
have used it's a it's a reality it's like what are your views about I don't know about the Sun rising in the morning
I mean it's going to happen whether you have views on it or not the I think in
many ways and I am speaking now current currently I think people look at what
happened in China and say that they try
to see what lessons there are for us that if a country which went through the
travails and difficulties and problems that China did could today reach the
level that it has as probably the only other country of a commensurate size I
think there are there are you know
clearly lessons there for us I mean now the systems are very different the history is different I grant you all of
that so I think when people look at China today yes they look they they are
certainly not impervious to the fact that a major power has risen in our immediate proximity that we have a
complicated history which I know all of that is death but at the same time they all so look at the fact that here is a very
large part of humanity which has actually improved its lot in a very dramatic fashion I mean when when you
say China has risen it's really 20% of the world solving its problems in some form or the other so the other seventeen
eighty sixteen seventeen percent of the world looks at it and say you know there could be something in this for us too
in terms of how do they communicate well I think right now I would I would say
the President Xi and Prime Minister Modi have met five times in the last year and
I've been present at two of those meetings in China and then recently in
Russia and they clearly have a very you know comfortable chemistry you can see
that you know look at the pictures see how you know how they deal with each
other and my own senses that the ability to communicate is actually good possibly
has has improved in recent months thank you very much we have time for just just
one more one more question in in the middle of the middle row samhita Narayan
and Rajaratnam School of International Studies I would like to my question be on Iran
and you did mention the broad energy and connectivity spheres of intra India's interaction with it and as someone who
did recently visit in June I was wondering with the nuclear deal how do you see India's relationship with Iran
progressing like certain most specifically not just egg brought in any connectivity and I guess I would be my
focus on the first night well you know I
was in Iran in early June but by that time most people in our business took it
as a given that the nuclear agreement would happen so so it was more of
then if it is an if and while the details of the nuclear agreement were
obviously very important for the countries who are negotiating it and the countries who live in the immediate
proximity of Iran for us the focus was
much more on the the impact that the sanctions have had on the relationship
and then in a post sanctions situation you know how do you look at possibilities that have come up there
are two broad areas of interest for us there one is Iran as an energy power so
Iran was a very still is a very major supplier of oil to India but because of
the sanctions its market share had come down and I think rebuilding that
relationship improving the market share that were improving the market share is their concern we would be looking at you
know the possibilities of investing in in Iran's energy sector which tyll tyll
the sanctions are lifted is not obviously something which was a possibility the other part of the
conversation we're regarding connectivity because it's it's very clear to us that Iran won Iran is
important as we're on so so I mean it's a big economy it will be a growing economy particularly in a post
sanctioned situation you can see lot of pent up demand now sort of coming on the
market but the Iran is can offer us an
alternative route initially we used to think to Afghanistan but we are also now
increasingly focused on the fact it offers an alternative route to scintillation so there are array regimes
which which regulate this the you know for example there is an ash Chabad agreement which really connects Oman
Iran Turkmenistan and Afghanistan Uzbekistan
so we are I think today exploring with
Iran the possibilities of building a port in chahbahar discussing railway
connectivity northwards some Road connectivity we are already involved
with them in the north-south transport corridor which goes not out of Bandar
Abbas so so we see a lot of possibilities there and from our point
of view you know we welcome the the nuclear understanding that was reached we want normalization in that region we
think that a more sort of a situation
where there is a return to normal Commerce and business would would really
be very much to the advantage of all the countries concerned so you can expect a certain amount of activity there in the
coming years thank you very much foreign secretary I think we could we could go
on there are a number of people who would like to ask you questions as well but unfortunately we we have to stop
here thank you for answering all those questions so so frankly and in quite a
lot of detail and thanks to our audience for such a good range of questions your
your lecture today and I think your your responses to the the points raised by
the audience have really done a lot for our understanding of not just India's
relations with China and the US but of India's foreign policy and how its developing more broadly so I'd like to
thank you thank you very much indeed for that I think the discussion that we've had
today has has very important implications for for this region including of course for for Singapore so
we're very grateful to you for deepening our understanding of
the dynamics of India's foreign policy and its implications so thank you very
much again for delivering the 21st Fullerton lecture today thank you very
much thank you very much
